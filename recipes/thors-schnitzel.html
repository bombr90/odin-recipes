    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Two boneless pork steaks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>One large egg (lightly beaten)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko (or plain bread crumbs)</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Two cups oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat ~1/2" worth of oil in a shallow pan to ~330F.</li>
        <li>Place pork steaks between two sheets of parchment paper. Using a meat<br>
          mallet, pound meat until 1/4 inch thick. Lightly season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dredge and coat the flattened morsels of meat by first coating it in flour,<br>
            then dipping it in the beaten egg and finally sprinkling the panko to coat<br>
            it in its entirety.</li>
        <li>Fry Schnitzel immediately until coating is deep golden brown (approximately 2-3<br>
            minutes a side). </li>
        <li>transfer to cooling rack lined with paper towel to absorb excess oil for a<br>
        few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with slice of lemon and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
